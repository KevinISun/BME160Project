When you start coding, make sure to pull to make sure you are up to date.

git pull 



When you want to make a change, and when you are done with a coding session, run these commands.

git add (filename)
#This adds the file to the commit "batch"

git commit -m "(message here)"
# Document changes with your commit message, such as making edits to files 

git push
# this pushes whatever you commited to the remote repository.
